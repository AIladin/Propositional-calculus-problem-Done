# Propositional calculus problem
 Implementation of boolean logic formula.
 Allowed operators are implication and objection.

  ((x0 -> (x1 -> x2)) -> ((x0 -> x1) -> (x0 -> x2)))
  For proper work always use parenthesis around implication '(x0->x1)' and objection '(!x0)'

  Indexation of variable symbols should stars from '0'.
  
  Use tautology_test.py and TautologyTestCaseInput/Output.txt or BoolLogicFormula/BLFormula.py  for test.
  
 #Implemented formal proof
 
 Use PCF package tester.py, or look at .csv files in test_results.rar.
 
 Adequacy_L.csv is in the PCF without compression.
